# redStack

![redStack Banner](assets/redStack-banner.png)

> A self-contained Boot-to-Breach lab on AWS. Deploy a full red-team training environment in ~45 minutes: three C2 frameworks (Mythic, Sliver, Havoc), an Apache redirector, a Kali workstation, a Windows workstation, and a Guacamole portal. Two peered VPCs, header + URI gating, scanner blocking, optional OpenVPN routing for cyber ranges.

**📖 [Full documentation lives in the redStack Wiki →](https://github.com/BaddKharma/redStack/wiki)**

The wiki is the de facto operator handbook. This README is a thin landing page so you can find your way in. Everything you need to deploy, verify, run the C2 walkthroughs, troubleshoot, or extend the lab lives there.

---

> [!IMPORTANT]
> redStack is not a tutorial on how to use C2 frameworks. It's an environment that removes the infrastructure hurdle so you can focus on learning. **This lab is strictly for authorized training and lab environments only** (cyber ranges, self-hosted environments, personal lab VMs, etc.). Not intended for use in real-world engagements or against targets you do not own and have explicit written permission to test.

> [!CAUTION]
> **AWS TOS: use at your own risk.** Hosting C2 infrastructure on AWS may raise concerns under the [AWS Acceptable Use Policy](https://aws.amazon.com/aup/). Before deploying, review the AUP and submit the [AWS Penetration Testing / Simulated Events request form](https://aws.amazon.com/security/penetration-testing/). As long as you're using redStack exclusively for personal lab work and authorized training platforms, you're generally in the clear. To be safe, run redStack from a dedicated, single-purpose throwaway AWS account.

## Deploy in 5 Steps

| # | What | Where |
|---|------|-------|
| 1 | First-time AWS setup (account, IAM, CLI, SSH key, Kali Marketplace subscription) | **[Prerequisites](https://github.com/BaddKharma/redStack/wiki/02.-Prerequisites)** |
| 2 | Pick open or closed environment | **[Deployment Modes](https://github.com/BaddKharma/redStack/wiki/04.-Deployment-Mode-Architecture)** |
| 3 | Configure tfvars and `terraform apply` | **[Deploy](https://github.com/BaddKharma/redStack/wiki/04.-Deploy)** |
| 4 | Confirm Guacamole + Windows + internal DNS | **[Verify](https://github.com/BaddKharma/redStack/wiki/05.-Verify)** |
| 5 | Land first beacon: pick a C2 | **[Mythic](https://github.com/BaddKharma/redStack/wiki/10.-Mythic)** · **[Sliver](https://github.com/BaddKharma/redStack/wiki/11.-Sliver)** · **[Havoc](https://github.com/BaddKharma/redStack/wiki/12.-Havoc)** |

**Total time:** ~30-60 minutes on first deploy. Subsequent deploys: ~20-30 minutes.

**Returning operator?** [Quick-Start](https://github.com/BaddKharma/redStack/wiki/01.-Quick-Start) is the abbreviated path.

## What Gets Deployed

Seven EC2 instances across two peered VPCs. Two have public Elastic IPs (Guacamole portal + redirector); everything else is reachable only through Guacamole.

| Hostname | Role | Public IP |
|----------|------|-----------|
| `guac` | Guacamole portal (web SSH/RDP/VNC) | Yes |
| `redirector` | Apache reverse proxy + C2 frontend | EIP exposes 80/443 only |
| `mythic` | Mythic C2 server | No |
| `sliver` | Sliver C2 server | No |
| `havoc` | Havoc C2 server + desktop (VNC) | No |
| `windows` | Windows Server 2022 workstation | No |
| `kali` | Kali Linux workstation (AD enum + attack toolset) | No |

## Cost

Roughly **$0.27/hour** of compute while running. With `terraform destroy` between sessions (recommended), expected monthly cost is **~$15-20/month** for typical 5-10 hr/wk study cadence. Full breakdown including stop-vs-destroy tradeoffs: **[Cost-Management](https://github.com/BaddKharma/redStack/wiki/17.-Cost-Management)**.

> [!CAUTION]
> Forgetting a deployed lab is the #1 cause of unexpected AWS bills. Set a CloudWatch billing alarm before your first `terraform apply`.

## When Something Breaks

**[Troubleshooting](https://github.com/BaddKharma/redStack/wiki/18.-Troubleshooting)** covers the failure modes that actually come up: Mythic SSL cert, Sliver missing, Havoc build failed, agent not calling back, Marketplace `OptInRequired`, VPC limits, `redirect.rules` download issues, Kali user rename, `ssh -R` binding behavior, and more.

```

The Terraform code is one file per role: Sliver, Havoc, Redirector, and Kali each own their own `.tf`; Mythic / Guacamole / Windows live in `main.tf` alongside the shared VPC scaffolding. Setup scripts in `terraform/setup_scripts/` are rendered into user-data at apply time.

**Workflow:**

```bash
cd terraform
terraform init
terraform apply
```

The SSH private key (`rs-rsa-key.pem`) lives at the repo root; `terraform.tfvars.example` references it as `../rs-rsa-key.pem` from inside `terraform/`.
